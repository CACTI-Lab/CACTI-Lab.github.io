CACTI Lab is a research group in the [Hixon Center for Climate and the Environment](https://www.hmc.edu/hixon-center/) at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) led by [Lynn Kirabo](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~kirabo/). We do research in four core areas: Disability, Mobility Technologies, Climate Change Effects and Interventions. We are commited to contributing to the future of inclusive technologies.

We leverage qualitative and design research methods to answer the following key questions:
- How can we identify strategies that will contribute to climate action strategies?
- How can we design inclusive mobility technologies?
- How can we resist replicating legacy inequities in the design future technologies?

Our goal is for our findings to contribute to multiple communities, including academic research, industry practice, and emerging policy. 

Who can apply to the lab: Students at the Claremont Colleges or through the NSF REU summer program.
