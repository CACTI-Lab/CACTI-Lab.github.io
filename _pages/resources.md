## HCI/HCD courses

Human-centered design is the process of putting people's needs, perspectives, and values at the center of the design/engineering processes. The process usually borrows from fields such as Design, Sociology, CS, History, Anthropology,etc.

There are many courses at the Claremont Colleges that teach these principles:

- [CLES 120] Games for Climate Change Literacy
- [CS 120] Human-Centered Computing Methods
- [CLES 121] Climate Justice: Disability
- [CLES 122] Climate Justice: Building Futures
- [ENGR 186] Advanced Human-Centered Design 
- [EA 85] Design for Environmental Behavior Change 
- [ENGR 190BI] Design and Equity Seminar
- [ENGR 180] Human-Centered Design
- ... check out this detailed [list](https://hive7c.notion.site/56e58c5acf414ca3be6dc2268a122726?v=c49191b6f32446669f225b022f946e17) from the Hive.
