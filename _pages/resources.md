## human-centered courses

Human-centered design (HCD) is the process of putting people's needs, perspectives, and values at the center of the design/engineering processes. Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on understanding how people use computers and how we can design them better. HCD and HCI borrow from design, sociology, CS, history, and anthropology.

Many courses at the Claremont Colleges teach these principles:

- [CLES 120] Games for Climate Change Literacy
- [CS 120] Human-Centered Computing Methods
- [CLES 121] Climate Justice: Disability
- [CLES 122] Climate Justice: Building Futures
- [ENGR 186] Advanced Human-Centered Design 
- [EA 85] Design for Environmental Behavior Change 
- [ENGR 190BI] Design and Equity Seminar
- [ENGR 180] Human-Centered Design
- ... check out this [list of courses](https://hive7c.notion.site/56e58c5acf414ca3be6dc2268a122726?v=c49191b6f32446669f225b022f946e17) curated by the amazing humans at [the Hive](https://colleges.claremont.edu/thehive/).
