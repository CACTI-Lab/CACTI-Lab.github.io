  abstract = {This one-day in-person workshop invites together scholars from the CSCW community with expertise in immigration and displacement, climate change and sustainability, and/or mobility justice to consider the challenge of climate migration and how we, as a community, might respond. We draw from previous workshops on migration and displacement in CSCW and HCI, as well as draw in researchers from other related areas, e.g., ICTD, development scholarship, and sustainability sciences. In this workshop, participants aim to engage in an array of activities such as concept mapping, archival creation, research proposal ideation and presentations. Outcomes will include the development of a community of scholars working at the nexus of these crises, common understanding of relevant concepts and themes, and a shared research agenda to guide future work.},

  abstract = {In this session, we aim to foster a community of computer science faculty across many primarily undergraduate institutions. We will foster an inclusive environment through activities that allow for multiple forms of engagement (e.g. shows of hands, small group introductions, and full group discussion). We will facilitate discussions about ways computer science is changing at PUIs and brainstorm ways that our community can be sustained outside of the SIGCSE TS.},
