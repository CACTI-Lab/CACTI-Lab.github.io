abstract = {As climate change continues to impact disabled communities around the world disproportionately, there is an urgent call to design accessible climate change interventions. However, there is a need first to understand the lived experiences of disabled populations experiencing the effects of climate change. In this poster, we analyze a diverse range of source documents (N = 168) to characterize these experiences. We highlight five themes embedded in the source documents, including the inaccessibility of the climate movement and the compounding toll on mental and physical health. Finally, we present an open call to the community as initial steps toward designing accessible climate change interventions.},

  abstract = {This one-day in-person workshop invites together scholars from the CSCW community with expertise in immigration and displacement, climate change and sustainability, and/or mobility justice to consider the challenge of climate migration and how we, as a community, might respond. We draw from previous workshops on migration and displacement in CSCW and HCI, as well as draw in researchers from other related areas, e.g., ICTD, development scholarship, and sustainability sciences. In this workshop, participants aim to engage in an array of activities such as concept mapping, archival creation, research proposal ideation and presentations. Outcomes will include the development of a community of scholars working at the nexus of these crises, common understanding of relevant concepts and themes, and a shared research agenda to guide future work.},

  abstract = {There is considerable effort within the HCI community to explore, document, and advocate for the lived experiences of persons with disabilities (PWDs). However, PWDs from the Global South, particularly Africa, are underrepresented in this scholarship. We contribute to closing this gap by investigating the unmet transit needs and characterization of technology within the disability community in Kampala, Uganda. We investigated transportation due to the increase in ride-share solutions created by widespread mobile computing and the resulting disruption of transportation worldwide. We hosted co-design sessions with disability advocates and adapted the stakeholder tokens method from the value-sensitive design framework to map the stakeholder ecosystem. Our key insight is the identification of a new group of non-traditional core stakeholders who highlight the values of inclusion, mobility, and safety within the ecosystem. Finally, we discuss how our findings engage with concepts of disability justice and perceptions of power.},
